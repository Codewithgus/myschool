        places where love and respect for humankind is developed,natured and
        brought to maturity;where knowledge is shared and where creativity and

        schools welcome all who search for knowledge imbused with christian
        values, principle and pratices. <br />

      <h2>the background of mary help of christians catholic school</h2>
      <p>
        mary help of christians catholic high school was founded by the salesians
        of don bosco and opened officially on the 17 <sup>th</sup> november 2003.
        it began its first lessons in the rooms located in don bosco youth centre
        during the war. the salesian community knew the great value of a catholic
        school in matadi for the needs of the neighborhood youth. this dream came
        true also through the encouragement and support of the parishioners of holy
        innocent parish,new matadi-estate.
        <p>fr.blamoh harris, the first principal of the school, in accordance with the regualtion of ces, hired teachers and
          received the needed suppot then from the ces. the first graduation exercise took place in november 2013.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>administration</h2>
      <p><q> in a catholic institution of learning, administration is characterized by service,responsibily,loyalty
        borne out of love and respect for others,for the institution and for the church </q>
        <p><q>administration must create suitable working and learning condition for all concerned and within the
          frame work of these policies make necessary changes and adjustments or addition which will contribute to the smooth runnign of the institution.
        </q></p>
        <p>the salesian community is the overall administrative organ and is prsent in the day-to-day activities of the institute through the
          principal. the principal will constuture the administrative board.
        </p>
        <p>the administrative team consists of the principal,the vice-principal(s),the finance officer,registrar and the fean of students
          the administration team is chaired by the principal and is cited to meeting by him. the administration should be able to meet at least once in two weeks
          when special need arises, after the administrative team meeting(s), if there are decisions to bemade based on the meeting, the final word rests on the principal
           in the decision making through he seeks to get the support of the rest fo the administrative team members.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>the teaching staff</h2>
      <p>the staff in catholic schools are called to exercise professionalism at all times in the spirit of christian
         witness, the staff should at all times be a model of good moral behavior both intellectual and moral,expect form the staff
         understanding,patience,commitment and love. the teaching staff should not manipulate,abuse or destroy the innocence
         of our children. they must not be manipulated or exploited financially,sexually or otherwise. each student is unique and must be treated
         as such. a staff in mary help of christians catholic school is expected to conduct him/herself becomingly in the campus and outside of it.
         <p>the teaching staff is expected to prepare his/her lessons and impart the same with deligence,patience and love. they must be models of human virtues
          like honesty,commitment,moral uprightness,understanding,obedience,patience,humility,decency,truthfulness. we put much emphasis on their well-being and development in
          all aspects of human existence. administrators and teaching staff who do not love,respect,honor,accept,and protect our children as children of god and look at these children as a gifts
          from god to them have no place in the catholic schools. the students are God's own and ours.
         </p>
      </p>
      <h2>the students</h2>
      <p>the catholic schools are places where we bring up our children well morally,spiritually and intellectually. the rationale behind the
        existence of our schools is nothing but the children who come to our schools.
        <p>students are required to be good,respectful,obedient,and hardworking and are expected to carry out the tasks given them. we expect the best
          of their intellectual performances,and to be studious and determined to carry out their academics tasks. they must be able to meet the demands
          of academics and co-curricular activities. they are expected to be punctual and self-disciplined.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2> chain of command</h2>
      <p>it is necessary that the students, the parents and the staff know the chain of command and be governed accordingly. in dealing with problems involving students
        the following procedures must be followed:
        <ul>
          <li>the subject teacher</li>
          <li>the sponsor</li>
          <li>the dean of students</li>
          <li>the vice-principal for instructions/or any other administrators</li>
          <li>the principal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          any misunderstanding among/between teachers must be handled by the dean of students/one of the administrators.
          generally,the principal should be the last person to get involved in solving the problem. the teachers/other employees of the institution are not
          allowed to go to catholic secretariat or any other authorities by-passing the school administration especially the principal.
